msgid "## Introduction"
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:25
msgid "TW Blue is an application to make Twitter simple and fast, while using as few resources as possible. With it, you can do things like the following:"
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:28
msgid "* Tweet, reply, retweet and delete tweets,"
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:29
msgid "* Mark and unmark a tweet as a favourite,"
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:30
msgid "* Send and delete direct messages,"
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:31
msgid "* See your friends and followers,"
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:32
msgid "* Follow, unfollow, report as spam and block a user,"
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:33
msgid "* Open a user's timeline to see only their tweets,"
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:34
msgid "* Open URLs from a tweet or direct message,"
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:35
msgid "* Play several types of audio files from addresses,"
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:36
msgid "* And more."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:39
msgid "## Usage"
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:42
msgid "In order to use an application like TW Blue which allows you to manage your Twitter account, you must first be registered on it. It's beyond the scope of this document to explain how to do so. We'll start from the premise that you have an account with its corresponding user name and password."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:45
msgid "### Authorising the application"
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:48
msgid "First off, it's necessary to authorise the program so it can access your Twitter account and act on your behalf. The authorisation process is quite simple, and the program never gets data such as your username and password. In order to authorise the application, you just need to run the main executable file, called TWBlue.exe (on some computers it may appear simply as TWBlue)."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:51
msgid "Whether this is the first time you open TWBlue or you don't have any session, you will see the session manager. This dialog allows you to authorise as many accounts as you wish. If you press the \"new account\" button a dialog will tell you that your default browser will be opened in order to authorise the application. Press \"yes\" so the process may start."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:54
msgid "Your default browser will open on the Twitter page to request authorisation. Enter your user name and password if you're not already logged in, look for the authorise button, and press it."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:57
msgid "Once you've authorised your twitter account, Twitter will redirect you to a web page which will notify you that TWBlue has been authorised successfully. Now you are able to close that window and come back to the session manager. You will see on the session list a new item temporally called \"Authorised account x\" -where x is a number. The session name will change once you open that session."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:60
msgid "To start running TWBlue, press the Ok button in the session manager dialog. By default, TWBlue starts all the configured sessions, however, you can change this behavior."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:63
msgid "If all went well, the application will start playing sounds, indicating your data are being updated."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:66
msgid "When the process is finished, the program will play another sound, and the screen reader will say \"ready\"."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:69
msgid "## The program's interface"
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:72
msgid "The easiest way to describe the graphical user interface of TWBlue is saying that the application has a window which contains a menu bar with five menus (application, tweet, user, buffer and help); one tree view, one list of items and, mostly in every case, three buttons: Tweet, retweet and reply. The actions that are available for every item will be described later."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:75
msgid "In the tree view are inserted buffers which are lists to manage the processed data. When you configure a new session on TWBlue and start it, your account is the root of the tree view. Inside of it  many buffers are created.  Each one of them may contain some of the items which TWBlue works with: Tweets, direct messages, users, trends or events. According to the buffer you were, you will be able to make different actions with these items."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:78
msgid "The following is a description for every kind of TWBlue's buffer and the kind of items they work with."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:81
msgid "* Home: it shows all the tweets on the main timeline. These are the tweets by users you follow."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:82
msgid "* Mentions: if a user, whether you follow them or not, mentions you on Twitter, you will find it on this list."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:83
msgid "* Direct messages: here go the private direct messages you exchange with users you follow and who follow you back. This list only shows received messages."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:84
msgid "* Sent: it shows all the tweets and direct messages sent from your account."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:85
msgid "* Favourites: here you will see all tweets you have favourited."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:86
msgid "* Followers: when users follow you, you'll be able to see them on this list, with some of their account information."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:87
msgid "* Friends: the same as the previous list, but these are the users you follow."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:88
msgid "* User timelines: these are lists you may create. They contain only the tweets by a specific user. They're used so you can see the tweets by a single person and you don't want to look all over your timeline. You may create as many as you like."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:89
msgid "* Events: An event is anything that happens on Twitter, such as when someone follows you, when someone adds or removes one of your tweets from their favorites list, or when you subscribe to a list.  There are many more but TW Blue shows the most common ones in the events buffer so that you can easily keep track of what is happening on your account."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:90
msgid "* Lists: A list is similar to a temporary timeline, except that you can configure it to contain tweets from multiple users."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:91
msgid "* Search: A search buffer contains the results of a search operation."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:92
msgid "* User favorites: You can have TW Blue create a buffer containing tweets favorited by a particular user."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:93
msgid "* Trending Topics: a trend buffer shows the top ten most used terms in a geographical region. This region may be a country or a city. Trends are updated every five minutes."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:96
msgid "If there's a URL on a tweet, TW Blue will try to open it when you press enter on it. If there are several, it will show you a list with all of them so you choose the one you want. If you're on the followers or friends buffer, the enter key will show you additional information about them."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:99
msgid "If you press control-enter, TW Blue will try to play the audio from the focused tweet, as long as it has a URL. If it has the #audio hashtag, you will hear a sound when it is selected, letting you know you can try to play it. However, a tweet can be missing the hashtag and TW Blue will still be able to play it so long as it contains a URL with audio."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:102
msgid "You will also hear a sound when you see any tweet containing geographical information. You can see someone's location by selecting the option \"view address\" from the tweet menu on the menu bar."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:105
msgid "## Controls"
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:108
msgid "Beginning with the 0.36 version, there's support for an interface which does not require a visible window. It can be activated by pressing control-m, or choosing hide window from the application menu. This interface is entirely driven through shortcut keys. These shortcuts are different from those used to drive the graphical interface.  By default, you can't use the invisible interface shortcuts on the GUI. It has been made this way to keep  compatibility with applications like TheQube and Chicken nugget which may use the same shortcuts. If you wish to have available the invisible interface shortcuts even if you are using the GUI, activate this option on the General tab of the preferences dialogue. This section describes both the graphical and the invisible interface."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:111
msgid "### The graphical user interface (GUI)"
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:114
msgid "Here you have a list divided into two parts. On the one hand, the buttons you will find while tabbing around on the program's interface, and on the other, the different elements present on the menu bar."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:117
msgid "#### Buttons on the application"
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:120
msgid "* Tweet: this button opens up a dialogue box to write your tweet. The message must not exceed 140 characters. If you write past this limit, a sound will play to warn you. You may use the shorten and expand URL buttons to comply with the character limit. You can translate your message, upload a picture, check spelling or attach audio by selecting one of the available buttons in the dialogue. Press enter to send the tweet. If all goes well, you'll hear a sound confirming it. Otherwise, the screen reader will say an error message in English describing the problem."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:121
msgid "* Retweet: this button retweets the message you're reading. After you press it, you'll be asked if you want to add a comment or simply send it as written."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:122
msgid "* Reply: when you're viewing a tweet, you can reply to the user who sent it by pressing this button. A dialogue will open up like the one for tweeting, but with the name of the user already filled in (for example @user) so you only need to write your message. If there are more users mentioned on the tweet, you can press shift-tab and press the mention all users button. When you're on the friends or followers lists, the button will be called mention instead."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:123
msgid "* Direct message: exactly like sending a tweet, but it's a private message which can only be read by the user you send it to. Press shift-tab to see the recipient. If there were other users mentioned on the tweet you were reading, you can arrow up or down to choose which one to send it to, or write the username yourself without the at sign."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:126
msgid "Bear in mind that buttons will appear according to which actions are possible on the list you are browsing. For example, on the home timeline, mentions, sent, favourites and user timelines you will see the four buttons, while on the direct messages list you'll only get the direct message and tweet buttons, and on friends and followers lists you will get the direct message, tweet, and mention buttons."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:129
msgid "#### Menus"
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:132
msgid "On top of the program window there's a menu bar which has the same functions, and some more. To access the menu bar, press alt. You will find five: application, tweet, user, buffer and help. This section describes the items on each one of them."

The trending topics buffer will be created once pressing \"ok\" on this dialog. Remember this kind of buffer will be updated every five minutes."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:143
