msgid "TWBlue is an application to make Twitter simple and fast, while using as few resources as possible. With TWBlue, you can do things like the following:"
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:28
msgid "* Tweet, reply to, retweet and delete tweets,"
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:29

msgid "## Usage"
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:42
msgid "Twitter is a social networking or micro-blogging tool which allows you to compose short status updates of your activities in 140 characters or less. Twitter is a way for friends, family and co-workers to communicate and stay connected through the exchange of quick, frequent messages. You can restrict delivery of updates to those in your circle of friends or, by default, allow anyone to access them."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:45
msgid "You can monitor the status of updates from your friends, family or co-workers (known as following), and they in turn can read any updates you create, (known as followers). The updates are referred to as Tweets. The Tweets are posted to your Twitter profile or Blog and are searchable using Twitter Search."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:48
msgid "In order to use TWBlue, you must first have created an account on the Twitter website. The process for signing up for a Twitter account is very accessible. During the account registration, you will need to choose a Twitter username. This serves two purposes. This is the method through which people will comunicate with you, but most importantly, your username and password will be required to connect TWBlue to your Twitter account. We suggest you choose a username which is memorable both to you and the people you hope will follow you."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:51
msgid "We'll start from the premise that you have a Twitter account with its corresponding username and password."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:54
msgid "### Authorising the application"
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:57
msgid "First of all, it's necessary to authorise the program so it can access your Twitter account and act on your behalf. The authorisation process is quite simple, and the program never retains data such as your password. In order to authorise the application, you just need to run the main executable file, called TWBlue.exe (on some computers it may appear simply as TWBlue if Windows Explorer is not set to display file extensions). We suggest you may like to place a Windows shortcut on your Desktop pointing to this executable file for quick and easy location."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:60
msgid "TWBlue allows you to monitor several Twitter accounts simultaneously. The program refers to each Twitter account you have configured as a \"Session\". If this is the first time you have launched TWBlue, and if no Twitter session exists, you will see the Session Manager. This dialogue box allows you to authorise as many accounts as you wish. If you press the Tab key to reach the \"new account\" button and activate it by pressing the Space Bar, a dialogue box will advise you that your default internet browser will be opened in order to authorise the application and you will be asked if you would like to continue. Activate the \"yes\" Button by pressing the letter \"Y\" so the process may start."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:63
msgid "Your default browser will open on the Twitter page to request authorisation. Enter your username and password into the appropriate edit fields if you're not already logged in, select the authorise button, and press it."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:66
msgid "Once you've authorised your twitter account, the website will redirect you to a page which will notify you that TWBlue has been authorised successfully. Now you are able to close the page by pressing ALT+F4 which will return you to the Session Manager. On the session list, you will see a new item temporarily called \"Authorised account x\" -where x is a number. The session name will change once you open that session."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:69
msgid "To start running TWBlue, press the Ok button in the Session Manager dialogue. By default, TWBlue starts all the configured sessions automatically, however, you can change this behavior."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:72
msgid "If all went well, the application will start playing sounds, indicating your data is being updated."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:75

msgid "## General concepts"
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:81
msgid "Before starting to describe TWBlue's usage, we'll explain some concepts that will be used extensively throughout this manual."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:84
msgid "### Buffer"
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:87
msgid "A buffer is a list of items to manage the data which arrives from Twitter, after being processed by the application. When you configure a new session on TWBlue and start it, many buffers are created.  Each  of them may contain some of the items which TWBlue works with: Tweets, direct messages, users, trends or events. According to the buffer you are focusing, you will be able to do different actions with these items."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:90
msgid "The following is a description for every one  of TWBlue's buffers and the kind of items they work with."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:93
msgid "* Home: this shows all the tweets on the main timeline. These are the tweets by users you follow."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:94
msgid "* Mentions: if a user, whether you follow them or not, mentions you on Twitter, you will find it in this list."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:95
msgid "* Direct messages: here you will find the private direct messages you exchange with users who follow you , or with any user, if you allow direct messages from everyone (this setting is configurable from Twitter). This list only shows received messages."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:96
msgid "* Sent direct messages: this buffer shows all the direct messages sent from your account."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:97
msgid "* Sent tweets: this shows all the tweets  sent from your account."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:98
msgid "* Favourites: here you will see all the tweets you have favourited."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:99
msgid "* Followers: when users follow you, you'll be able to see them on this list, with some of their account details."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:100
msgid "* Friends: the same as the previous list, but these are the users you follow."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:101
msgid "* User timelines: these are  buffers you may create. They contain only the tweets by a specific user. They're used so you can see the tweets by a single person and you don't want to look all over your timeline. You may create as many as you like."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:102
msgid "* Events: An event is anything that happens on Twitter, such as when someone follows you, when someone adds or removes one of your tweets from their favourites list, or when you subscribe to a list.  There are many more, but TWBlue shows the most common ones in the events buffer so that you can easily keep track of what is happening on your account."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:103
msgid "* Lists: A list is similar to a  user timeline, except that you can configure it to contain tweets from multiple users."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:104
msgid "* Search: A search buffer contains the results of a search operation."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:105
msgid "* User favourites: You can have TWBlue create a buffer containing tweets favourited by a particular user."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:106
msgid "* Trending Topics: a trend buffer shows the top ten most used terms in a geographical region. This region may be a country or a city. Trends are updated every five minutes."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:109
msgid "If a tweet contains a URL, you can press enter in the GUI or Control + Windows + Enter in the invisible interface to open it. If it contains audio, you can press Control + Enter or Control + Windows + Alt + Enter to play it, respectively. TWBlue will play a sound if the tweet contains the #audio hashtag, but there may be tweets which contain audio without this. Finally, if a tweet contains geographical information, you can press   Control + Windows + G in the invisible interface to retrieve it."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:112
msgid "### Username fields"
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:115
msgid "These fields accept a Twitter username (without the at sign) as the input. They are present in the send direct message and the user actions   dialogue boxes. Those dialogues will be discussed later. The initial value of these fields depends on where they were opened from. They are prepopulated with the username of the  sender of the focused tweet (if they were  opened from  the home and sent timelines, from users'' timelines or from lists), the sender of the focused direct message (if from the received or sent direct message buffers) or in the focused user (if from the followers' or friends' buffer). If  one of those dialogue boxes is opened from a tweet, and if there are more users mentioned in it, you can use the arrow keys to  switch between them. Alternatively, you can also type a username."

msgid "#### Buttons in the application"
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:140
msgid "* Tweet: this button opens up a dialogue box to write your tweet. The message must not exceed 140 characters.  If you write past this limit, a sound will play to warn you. Note that the character count is displayed in the title bar. You may use the shorten and expand URL buttons to comply with the character limit. You can  upload a picture, check spelling, attach audio or translate your message by selecting one of the available buttons in the dialogue box. In addition, you can autocomplete the entering of users by pressing Alt + A or the button for that purpose if you have the database of users configured. Press enter to send the tweet. If all goes well, you'll hear a sound confirming it. Otherwise, the screen reader will speak an error message in English describing the problem."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:141
msgid "* Retweet: this button retweets the message you're reading. After you press it, if you haven't configured the application not to do so, you'll be asked if you want to add a comment or simply send it as written. If you choose to add a comment, and if the original tweet plus the comment exceeds 140 characters, you will be asked if you want to post it as a comment   with a mention to the original user and a link to the originating tweet."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:142
msgid "* Reply: when you're viewing a tweet, you can reply to the user who sent it by pressing this button. A dialogue will open up similar to the one for tweeting, but with the name of the user already filled in (for example @user) so you only need to write your message. If there are more users referred to in the tweet, you can press shift-tab and activate the mention all users button. When you're on the friends or followers lists, the button will be called mention instead."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:143
msgid "* Direct message: exactly like sending a tweet, but it's a private message which can only be read by the user you send it to. Press shift-tab to see the recipient. If there were other users mentioned in the tweet you were reading, you can arrow up or down to choose which one to send it to, or write the username yourself without the at sign."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc\strings.py:146
msgid "Bear in mind that buttons will appear according to which actions are possible on the list you are browsing. For example, on the home timeline, mentions, sent, favourites and user timelines you will see the four buttons, while on the direct messages list you'll only get the direct message and tweet buttons, and on friends and followers lists the direct message, tweet, and mention buttons will be available."
